User Information:
- Goal: "{goal}"
- Selected Intent: "{intent_title}"
- Answer Content: {answer_context}
- Country: "{user_country or 'Not specified'}"
- Language: "{user_language or 'Not specified'}"

## Core Principles

Each checklist item must meet these 3 conditions:
1. Immediately Actionable: Concrete actions that can be started today
2. Clear Completion Criteria: Actions that can be clearly marked as "done/not done"
3. Logical Flow: Natural progression order overall

## Checklist Generation Process

### Step 1: Answer Information Classification and Evaluation
Information types to count:
- Time information: deadlines, frequency, duration
- Resource information: budget, tools, space
- Condition information: level, experience, constraints
- Method information: alone/together, online/offline

Information completeness:
- Detailed: 4+ types
- Moderate: 2-3 types
- Simple: 0-1 types

### Step 2: Item Count Guide
- Short-term (within 2 weeks): Choose from 4-5 items
- Medium-term (within 3 months): Choose from 6-7 items
- Long-term (3+ months): Choose from 8-9 items

### Step 3: Order Display Rules
Show arrows only for sequential relationships:
- "Record practice → Identify improvement points"
- "Learn basics → Apply in practice"

List parallel items without arrows:
- "Take nutritional supplements"
- "Prepare workout clothes"
- "Install fitness app"

### Step 4: Item-by-Item Detailed Guide

**Preparation/Setup Stage (1-2 items)**
- Tools, environment, account preparation, etc.
- Examples: "Buy workout clothes and shoes", "Register at gym"

**Learning/Information Gathering (1-2 items)**
- Learning methods, researching information, etc.
- Examples: "Watch basic exercise videos", "Plan diet schedule"

**Execution/Practice Stage (majority)**
- Actual actions to achieve the goal
- Examples: "Exercise 30 minutes, 3 times per week", "Drink 2L water daily"

**Review/Improvement Stage (1 item)**
- Mid-point check, adjustment, improvement
- Examples: "Review progress after one month", "Adjust exercise routine"

## Style and Expression Guide

### Preferred Expressions
- Action-oriented verbs
- "Daily/3 times per week" (specific frequency)
- "For 30 minutes" (clear timeframe)
- "Install XX app" (specific tools)

### Expressions to Avoid
- "Think about XX" (abstract)
- "Work hard" (vague)
- "Sometimes" (unclear frequency)
- "Moderately" (unclear degree)

## Final Checklist Requirements

### Mandatory Conditions
- Total {min_items or settings.MIN_CHECKLIST_ITEMS}-{max_items or settings.MAX_CHECKLIST_ITEMS} items
- Each item 15-40 characters long
- Start with action verbs
- Show arrows (→) only for sequential relationships

### Quality Standards
- Concrete actions that can be started today
- Clearly distinguishable as "completed/not completed"
- Reflect user's answer content as much as possible
- Consider country/language-specific characteristics
