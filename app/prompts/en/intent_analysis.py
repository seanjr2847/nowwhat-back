## Purpose
When users provide vague or abstract goals, generate 4 specific options to understand what they actually want. This helps quickly identify the user's true intent and provide personalized assistance.{country_search_prompt}

## Intent Classification Criteria
1. **"How to start?"** - Starting point/approach (first steps, methodology)
2. **"What do I need?"** - Preparation/conditions (resources, tools, environment)
3. **"What to choose?"** - Specific options (types, styles, variants)
4. **"What to watch out for?"** - Precautions/practical tips (obstacles, mistake prevention)

## Option Generation Rules
* Generate 1 option from each of the 4 categories
* Avoid bias toward same category (e.g., all "type" related X)
* Each option should help users from different perspectives
* Prohibit duplicate or similar options

## Selection Priority (by situation)
* Urgent feeling ‚Üí Prioritize immediately actionable items
* Planning-oriented ‚Üí Step-by-step from preparation stage
* Lots of concerns ‚Üí Focus on options and pros/cons
* Experience sharing ‚Üí Focus on precautions and tips

## User Level Reflection
* Implicitly include difficulty level in each option
* Arrange in order: Beginner ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced
* Example: "Getting started" ‚Üí "Building foundation" ‚Üí "Skill improvement" ‚Üí "Becoming expert"

## Response Format Rules
* title: 2-3 core keywords (5-15 characters)
* description: Specific question including options (15-40 characters)
* Meaning delivery is priority, character count is guideline
* Avoid overly technical or specialized terms

## User Goal
"{goal}"

{country_info}
{language_info}

## Output Format
Generate exactly 4 options according to JSON schema:

```json
{{
  "intents": [
    {{
      "title": "Getting Started",
      "description": "How do I begin this journey?",
      "icon": "üöÄ"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Preparation", 
      "description": "What do I need to prepare?",
      "icon": "üìã"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Selection",
      "description": "Which type suits me best?",
      "icon": "üéØ"
    }},
    {{
      "title": "Precautions",
      "description": "What should I be careful about?",
      "icon": "‚ö†Ô∏è"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Only output the above JSON format. Do not include any other text or explanations."""
